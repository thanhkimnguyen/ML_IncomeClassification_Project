# ML_IncomeClassification_Project
The project includes a complete end-to-end workflow: data preprocessing (missing value imputation, outlier handling, rare category grouping, encoding, scaling, PCA), model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and result visualization

## Project Structure and Workflow
This project is executed entirely within a Google Colab Notebook and follows the standard machine learning workflow:

1.  **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, data cleaning, and outlier treatment.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Encoding categorical variables, scaling, and feature creation.
3.  **Model Selection:** Experimentation with various algorithms [Logistic Regression, Supprot Vector Machine, Random Forest, MLP].
4.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing the best-performing model.
5.  **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using key metrics [Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, ROC_AUC].

## Setup and Usage Requirements
