## III. OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT
The project includes a complete end-to-end workflow: data preprocessing (missing value imputation, outlier handling, rare category grouping, encoding, scaling, PCA), model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and result visualization
This project is executed entirely within a Google Colab Notebook and follows the standard machine learning workflow:
            **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, data cleaning, and outlier treatment.
            **Feature Engineering:** Encoding categorical variables, scaling, and feature creation.
            **Model Selection:** Experimentation with various algorithms
            **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing the best-performing model.
            **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using key metrics
